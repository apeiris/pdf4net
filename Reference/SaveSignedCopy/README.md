The `SaveSignedCopy` sample shows how to save the copy of a PDF document that is covered by a digital signature.

The input document has been signed (field Signature1) then a stamp has been added to first page and a second signature on the second page.
The sample saves the copy covered by the first signature, so the stamp and 2nd signature are not included.
