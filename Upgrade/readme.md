The Upgrade folder contains the old [**PDF4NET**](https://o2sol.com/pdf4net/overview.htm) samples that have been upgraded to [**PDF4NET**](https://o2sol.com/pdf4net/overview.htm) 10.

The lines of code that need to be updated are commented with //PDF4NET v5: 

Below them are written the lines of code that replaces them.

For example:

    //PDF4NET v5: PDFDocument doc = new PDFDocument();
    PDFFixedDocument doc = new PDFFixedDocument();
