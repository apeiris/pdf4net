The Upgrade folder contains the old PDF4NET samples that have been upgraded to PDF4NET 10.
The lines of code that need to be updated are commented with //PDF4NET v5: 
Below them are written the lines of code that replaces them.
For example:

    //PDF4NET v5: PDFDocument doc = new PDFDocument();
    PDFFixedDocument doc = new PDFFixedDocument();
